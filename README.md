# Rusty Todos 🦀

A fun little experiment for to help me brush up on my Rust.

This is a simple little GraphQL ToDo Api built with:

- Rust (obviously)
- [Async Graphql](https://github.com/async-graphql/async-graphql)
- AWS Lambda (via SAM and cargo-lambda)
- DynamoDB
- [serde_dynamo](https://github.com/zenlist/serde_dynamo) 🙂
